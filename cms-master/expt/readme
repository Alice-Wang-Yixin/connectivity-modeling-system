This directory contains example input files for running getdata and cms, which can be adapted for your own use.

To check that your installation of CMS has worked correctly, you can also use these files to run a simple test:

1. Make sure you are in the directory /expt and that you have created links to the executables cms and getdata (see user guide).
You should see the directories *input\_getdata* and *input\_example*.

2. First, run getdata to download HYCOM data files needed to run the test using the example by typing:
> ./getdata getdata 1

3. Then, run the cms test using the example input files in input_example by typing:
> ./cms example

In this case, cms is run passively for 3 particles released on 3 consecutive days, with no turbulence or IBM.

If the test has worked correctly, you should get an output file called traj_file_1.nc in expt_example/output.

An example output file for the test is also given in expt_example/output called traj_file_example.nc with which to compare your results.

You can plot the output using cms-master/postproc/draw_traj_netcdf.m and compare with the example output:
